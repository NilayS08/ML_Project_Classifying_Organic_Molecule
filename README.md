# ML_Project_Classifying_Organic_Molecule

## Description
- Interpreting Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is crucial for identifying chemical compounds through their unique "molecular fingerprint," but traditional analysis relies heavily on human expertise, leading to potential inconsistency and error. The primary challenge is to develop a robust, systematic method to classify the functional groups of organic molecules directly from their IR spectra, thereby minimizing this human element.

- The goal is to leverage machine learning to automate and enhance this process. By training models like logistic regression, k-means clustering, and feedforward neural networks on raw spectral intensity data, the system will learn to recognize patterns associated with specific structural motifs. This approach aims to accurately and rapidly identify key functional groups, transforming molecular analysis by reducing reliance on subjective manual interpretation and significantly improving both the speed and reliability of compound identification. ðŸš€
