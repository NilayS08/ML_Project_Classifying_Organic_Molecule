## Presentation Flow (15-20 minutes)

### 1. Introduction (2 minutes)
**Page: üè† Home & Overview**

**What to say:**
> "Today I'm presenting an automated functional group classification system using IR spectroscopy and machine learning. The project combines chemistry and ML to solve a real analytical problem."

**Key points to highlight:**
- Multi-label classification (31 functional groups)
- Real IR spectroscopy data from QM9 dataset
- Automated labeling using SMILES strings
- Comprehensive pipeline from raw data to predictions

**What to show:**
- Scroll through the project objectives
- Point out the pipeline architecture diagram
- Mention key technologies (RDKit, Scikit-learn, SciPy)

---

### 2. Data Loading & Understanding (3 minutes)
**Page: üì• Data Loading & Processing**

**What to say:**
> "Let's start with the data. We have two datasets: SMILES strings representing chemical structures, and IR spectroscopy measurements. The challenge is to automatically label which functional groups are present."

**Key points to highlight:**
- SMILES notation explained (show examples)
- IR spectra are 1D arrays of intensity values
- Functional group distribution shows class imbalance
- Data alignment between SMILES and IR data

**What to show:**
- Scroll through sample SMILES
- Show raw IR spectra (adjust slider to show 4-6 samples)
- Point out the functional group distribution chart
- Highlight the top 10 most common groups

**TA might ask:**
- *"Why use SMILES for labeling?"*
  > "SMILES allows automated, rule-based labeling using SMARTS pattern matching via RDKit. This eliminates manual annotation of 31 functional groups across thousands of samples."

---

### 3. Feature Engineering (4 minutes)
**Page: üî¨ Feature Engineering**

**What to say:**
> "Raw IR spectra need significant preprocessing. We apply baseline correction to remove drift, Savitzky-Golay smoothing to reduce noise, and normalization to standardize intensities."

**Key points to highlight:**
- Three-step preprocessing pipeline
- Visual before/after comparison shows dramatic improvement
- Feature extraction: 196 features per spectrum
- Feature categories: regional, peaks, derivatives, moments

**What to show:**
- Explain each preprocessing step (in the info box)
- Use slider to show different samples' before/after
- Scroll to feature extraction section
- Show the correlation heatmap briefly

**TA might ask:**
- *"Why 196 features? Isn't that a lot?"*
  > "We divide the spectrum into 31 regions and extract 6 statistics each (186 features), plus peak information (4), derivatives (4), and spectral moments (2). The correlation analysis helps identify which features are actually useful."

- *"What is baseline correction?"*
  > "Asymmetric Least Squares method removes baseline drift and background signals that aren't related to molecular vibrations. This is standard in spectroscopy."

---

### 4. Model Training & Results (5 minutes)
**Page: ü§ñ Model Training & Results**

**What to say:**
> "I compared four different algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks. Each uses MultiOutputClassifier for multi-label classification."

**Key points to highlight:**
- Train-test split (80-20)
- Four different model architectures
- Multiple evaluation metrics for multi-label classification
- Best model identification

**What to show:**
- Point out training/test split numbers
- Click "Training Models" if not already done
- Wait for training to complete (~1 minute)
- Highlight the performance comparison table
- Point out the best model (usually Random Forest or Neural Network)
- Show the visual comparison chart

**TA might ask:**
- *"Why these metrics specifically?"*
  > "Multi-label classification requires different metrics than single-label. F1-Micro gives overall performance, F1-Macro accounts for class imbalance, Hamming Loss measures label-wise errors, and Jaccard Score measures set similarity."

- *"Why did you choose these models?"*
  > "I wanted to compare simple (Logistic Regression), ensemble (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting), and deep learning (Neural Network) approaches. Each has different strengths for this type of problem."

**Expand the metric explanations section** to show you understand evaluation metrics.

---

### 5. Detailed Analysis (3 minutes)
**Page: üìà Detailed Analysis**

**What to say:**
> "Let's dive deeper into performance. Not all functional groups are equally easy to detect. Some have clear IR signatures, others are more challenging."

**Key points to highlight:**
- Per-functional-group F1 scores
- Class imbalance affects performance
- Sample-wise and label-wise accuracy distributions
- Overall system reliability

**What to show:**
- Scroll through top 15 functional groups table
- Point out which groups perform best
- Show the F1-score bar chart
- Mention the support distribution (some groups are rare)
- Show the accuracy histograms

**TA might ask:**
- *"Why do some groups perform poorly?"*
  > "Usually due to class imbalance (few positive examples) or overlapping IR signatures between similar functional groups. The support column shows how many test samples contained each group."

---

### 6. Interactive Demo (3 minutes)
**Page: üß™ Try Your Own SMILES**

**What to say:**
> "Finally, let's see it in action. You can enter any SMILES string and the system will predict functional groups."

**Suggested demo sequence:**
1. **Ethanol (CCO)**
   - Should detect: O-H alcohol, C-H alkane, C-O alcohol
   
2. **Acetic Acid (CC(=O)O)**
   - Should detect: C-O carboxylic acid, O-H carboxylic acid, C-H alkane
   
3. **Benzene (c1ccccc1)**
   - Should detect: C-H aromatic, C-C aromatic

4. **Let TA suggest one!**

**What to show:**
- Type in SMILES string
- Click "Predict Functional Groups"
- Show the detected groups (green badges)
- Show molecular properties
- Scroll to complete analysis table

**TA might ask:**
- *"Can you try [their SMILES]?"*
  > Enter it and explain the results!

## Difficult Questions & Answers

### Q: "Couldn't you just use a CNN instead of manual feature engineering?"
**A:** "Absolutely! CNNs could learn features automatically. I chose traditional ML with manual features to demonstrate signal processing knowledge and ensure interpretability. For future work, I'd compare CNN performance."

### Q: "How do you handle overlapping functional groups?"
**A:** "That's exactly why this is multi-label classification. One molecule can have multiple functional groups. The SMARTS patterns detect all matches, and the ML model predicts probabilities for each label independently."

### Q: "What about the class imbalance problem?"
**A:** "Good observation! Some functional groups are rare. I use F1-Macro to account for this, and could implement techniques like SMOTE or class weights. The model still performs reasonably on rare classes."

### Q: "Is this approach better than traditional IR analysis?"
**A:** "Traditional analysis requires expert chemists to manually interpret peaks. This system automates initial screening but wouldn't replace expert analysis for critical applications. It's best for high-throughput preliminary analysis."

### Q: "What would you improve?"
**A:** 
1. Try deep learning (CNN, LSTM) for automatic feature learning
2. Implement ensemble methods combining multiple models
3. Use more training data
4. Add uncertainty quantification
5. Try transfer learning from pre-trained chemistry models

## Backup Talking Points

If you have extra time or want to impress:

1. **Chemistry Knowledge**: Explain what IR spectroscopy actually measures (molecular vibrations at specific wavenumbers)

2. **Signal Processing**: Discuss why Savitzky-Golay is better than simple smoothing (preserves peak shapes)

3. **Engineering**: Mention how this could be deployed (web API, mobile app for field chemists)

4. **Scalability**: Discuss how you'd handle millions of samples (batch processing, distributed computing)

5. **Validation**: Mention cross-validation could provide more robust performance estimates
